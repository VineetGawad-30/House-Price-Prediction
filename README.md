# House Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project implements and compares multiple regression models to predict house prices based on various property features. After identifying limitations in linear regression, a polynomial regression approach was applied to significantly improve predictive accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various features related to residential properties including:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Location information
- Property age
- Building quality metrics
- Amenities and features
- Sale conditions

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis to understand feature distributions and relationships
- Handling missing values through appropriate imputation methods
- Feature engineering to extract meaningful information
- Data transformation to improve model performance
- Outlier detection and treatment
- Feature scaling and normalization

### Model Development
1. **Linear Regression (Initial Approach)**
   - Implemented baseline linear regression model
   - Evaluated performance using R² and error metrics
   - Identified limitations in capturing non-linear relationships

2. **Polynomial Regression (Improved Approach)**
   - Transformed features to capture non-linear relationships
   - Optimized degree of polynomial features
   - Applied regularization to prevent overfitting

## Results
- Linear Regression: Limited predictive performance
- Polynomial Regression: Achieved strong predictive power
  - Training R² score: 0.82
  - Testing R² score: 0.83


## Key Insights
- Non-linear relationships significantly influence house prices
- Data transformation was crucial for improving model performance
- Polynomial features effectively captured complex interactions between variables
- Model demonstrates strong generalization with consistent performance on testing data

## Technical Implementation
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook


## Future Improvements
- Implement ensemble methods for potentially higher accuracy
- Explore deep learning approaches for complex feature interactions
- Add geographic visualization of price predictions
- Develop web application for interactive price predictions
